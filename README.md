# CMPG-323-Project-2---27593657

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

EcoPower logistics sells a wide range of parts and components essential for installing, functioning and optimising 
solar energy systems.
As part of the EcoPower Logistics project (project 2), I was tasked with creating a CRUD RESTful API that will 
connect to a database storing basic logistic data. Representiational State Transfer (REST) is an archtectual style 
for web services over HTTP. EcoPower services can be managed using the cloud when this model is used for API design.

In this project, the API will be connected to a data source to manage the interaction with the data source. 

# Requirements of the API:
The API contain at least one:
- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- DELETE
method per resource.

# Project Tasks:
- Configure the database
  Create a Sql Server database on Microsoft Azure and run script

- Create an API and connect the API to data the data source

- Functionalities
  Build Customer Management Functionality
  Build Order Management Functionality
  Build Product Manangement Functionality

- Host Web API on a cloud platform
